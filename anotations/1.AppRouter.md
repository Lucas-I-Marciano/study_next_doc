# Optimizing Fonts and Images

Cumulative Layout Shift is a metric used by Google to evaluate the performance and user experience of a website  
With fonts, layout shift happens when the browser initially renders text in a fallback or system font and then swaps it out for a custom font once it has loaded  
Next.js downloads font files at build time and hosts them with your other static assets

### Adding a primary font

- Font
  ```javascript
  import { Inter } from "next/font/google";
  export const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] });
  ```

### The <Image> component

- Image
  ```javascript
  import Image from "next/image";
  <Image
    src="/hero-desktop.png"
    width={1000}
    height={760}
    className="hidden md:block"
    alt="Screenshots of the dashboard project showing desktop version"
  />;
  ```

# Creating Layouts and Pages

### Nested routing

To create a nested route, you can nest folders inside each other and add page.tsx files inside them
The layout file is the best way to create a shared layout that all pages in your application can use

### Root layout

`/app/layout.tsx` File
